//     <!-- //   screen
//  Screen is window property that holds information of browser user screen.
//  It refers to screen object associated with that window object. 
// Used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc
// Similar to document screen can be accessed either by window.screen or screen object directly. 
//    Screen object doesnâ€™t have any methods as in window and document objects.
//  -->
//       <!-- window -->
// <!-- The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. 
// It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents 
// of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display 
// the contents of the document, the window object is created.
// The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document 
// that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets 
// loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, 
// URL, cookie, etc. What does this really mean? That means if you want to 
// access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document 
// it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property. -->
//         <!-- document -->
// <!-- The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser.
//  By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. 
//  With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. 
// The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document. -->
